Binary Tree-Each node has zero,one or two child.

Terminologies-->
Size-Number of Nodes

Height- The height of a node is the maximum number of nodes between the node and the leaf node.

Level-The number of nodes between the root node and the given node.

Degree-Number of child for a Node.



Types of binary tree-
1)Complete binary tree-
   -ALL level except the last is full.
   -Last level is filled from left to right.

2)Full Binary tree/strict
  -Each node has either zero or two children.    //Used in compression techniques

3)Perfect Binary tree-
  -All levels are full.
  -Leaf Nodes are at the same level 

4)Height Balanced
  -Average height is O(logN)

5)Skewed Binary Tree-
  -Each node has one child.
  -Height is O(N)----Similar to linked list.

6)Ordered Binary Tree-
  -Every Node has a property  ex-BST

Properties-
1)For a perfect binary tree if height=h  -->number of nodes=2^(h+1) -1
2)For a perfect binary tree,number of leaf nodes=2^height
3)For a binary tree,if number of nodes=N --->atlaest log(N+1) levels are their atleast.
4)For a strict binary tree,if N leaf nodes ---> number of internal nodes=N-1
5)Number of leaf nodes = 1+ external nodes with two children(not root)


Implementation-
1)linked representation     2)Sequential--using an array(size issues,will be used for heaps



Binary tree implementation---->>>


private class Node{            //class
       Node right;
       Node left;
       int val;

       public Node(int val) {
           this.val=val;
       }



public void populate(Scanner scanner){
         System.out.println("Enter the root node:");
         int val=scanner.nextInt();
          root=new Node(val);
          populate(scanner,root);    call the function with two argumnets
    }
    public void populate(Scanner scanner,Node node){
        System.out.println("Do you want to enter to the left of:"+node.val); 
        boolean left=scanner.nextBoolean();   
        if(left){  
          //checks if left node to be added,if false moves out of the if//
            System.out.println("Enter the number to be added to the left of"+node.val);
            int value=scanner.nextInt();
            node.left= new Node(value);
            populate(scanner,node.left);   recursive call
        }

        System.out.println("Do you want to enter to the right of:"+node.val);

        boolean right=scanner.nextBoolean();
        if(right){
       //checks if right node to be added,if false moves out of the if//
            System.out.println("Enter the number to be added to the right of"+node.val);
            int value=scanner.nextInt();
            node.right= new Node(value);
            populate(scanner,node.right);
        }

    } 

  
Balanced tree-height difference should be always equal to less than 1.

Binary Search tree-
less than root/node-add to to the left         greater than root/node-add to the right
                     15
                 10      20
               5    12
Insert,Search,Delete--O(logN)---height of tree
